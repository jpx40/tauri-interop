What this crate tries to achieve:
- generate an equal wasm-function for your defined `tauri::command`
- collecting all defined `tauri::command`s without adding them manually
- a convenient way to send events from tauri and receiving them in the frontend


## Basic usage:

> **Disclaimer**:

> Some examples in this documentation can't be executed with doctests due to
> required wasm target and tauri modified environment (see [withGlobalTauri](https://tauri.app/v1/api/config/#buildconfig.withglobaltauri))

### QOL macros

This crate also adds some quality-of-life macros. These are intended to ease the drawbacks of compiling to
multiple architectures. 

#### Conditional `use`
Because most crates are not intended to be compiled to wasm and most wasm crates are not intended to be compiled to
the host-triplet they have to be excluded in each others compile process. The usual process to exclude uses for a certain
architecture would look something like this:

```rust
#[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]
use tauri::AppHandle;

#[tauri_interop::command]
pub fn empty_invoke(_handle: AppHandle) {}
```

**General usage:**

With the help of `tauri_interop::host_usage!()` and `tauri_interop::wasm_usage!()` we don't need to remember which 
attribute we have to add and can just convert the above to the following:

```rust
tauri_interop::host_usage! {
    use tauri::AppHandle;
}

#[tauri_interop::command]
pub fn empty_invoke(_handle: AppHandle) {}
```

**Multiple `use` usage:**

When multiple `use` should be excluded, they need to be separated by a single pipe (`|`). For example:

```rust
tauri_interop::host_usage! {
    use tauri::State;
    | use std::sync::RwLock; 
}

#[tauri_interop::command]
pub fn empty_invoke(_state: State<RwLock<String>>) {}
```

### Command (Frontend => Backend Communication)
> For more examples see [cmd.rs](./test-project/api/src/cmd.rs) in test-project

Definition for both tauri supported triplet and wasm:
```rust , ignore-wasm32-unknown-unknown
#[tauri_interop::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}! You've been greeted from Rust!", name)
}

// generated the `get_handlers()` function
tauri_interop::collect_commands!();

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
    // This is where you pass in the generated handler collector
    .invoke_handler(get_handlers());
}
```

Using `tauri_interop::command` does two things:
- it provides the command with two macros which are used depending on the `target_family`
  - `tauri_interop::binding` is used when compiling to `wasm`
  - `tauri::command` is used otherwise
- it adds an entry to `tauri_interop::collect_commands!()` (see [collect commands](#collect-commands))
  - the function is not generated when targeting `wasm`

The defined command above can then be used in wasm as below. Due to receiving data from 
tauri via a promise, the command response has to be awaited.
```rust , ignore
#[tauri_interop::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}! You've been greeted from Rust!", name)
}

fn main() {
    console_log::init_with_level(log::Level::Info).unwrap();

    wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local(async move { 
        let greetings = greet("frontend").await;
        log::info!("{greetings}");
    });
}
```

#### Command representation Host/Wasm

- the returned type of the wasm binding should be 1:1 the same type as send from the "backend" 
  - technically all commands need to be of type `Result<T, E>` because there is always the possibility of a command 
    getting called, that isn't registered in the context of tauri
    - when using `tauri_interop::collect_commands!()` this possibility is fully™️ removed
    - for convenience, we ignore that possibility, and even if the error occurs it will be logged into the console
- all arguments with `tauri` in their name (case-insensitive) are removed as argument in a defined command
  - that includes `tauri::*` usages and `Tauri` named types
  - the crate itself provides type aliases for tauri types usable in a command (see [type_aliases](./src/command/type_aliases.rs))
- most return types are automatically determined
  - when using a return type with `Result` in the name, the function will also return a `Result`
  - that also means, if you create a type alias for `Result<T, E>` and don't include `Result` in the name of the alias, 
    it will not map the `Result` correctly

```rust , ignore-wasm32-unknown-unknown
// let _: () = trigger_something();
#[tauri_interop::command]
fn trigger_something(name: &str) {
    print!("triggers something, but doesn't need to wait for it")
}

// let value: String = wait_for_sync_execution("value").await;
#[tauri_interop::command]
fn wait_for_sync_execution(value: &str) -> String {
    format!("Has to wait that the backend completes the computation and returns the {value}")
}

// let result: Result<String, String> = asynchronous_execution(true).await;
#[tauri_interop::command]
async fn asynchronous_execution(change: bool) -> Result<String, String> {
    if change {
        Ok("asynchronous execution requires result definition".into())
    } else {
        Err("and ".into())
    }
}

// let _wait_for_completion: () = heavy_computation().await;
#[tauri_interop::command]
async fn heavy_computation() {
  std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(5000))
}
```

#### Collect commands

The `tauri_invoke::collect_commands` macro generates a `get_handlers` function in the current mod, which calls the 
`tauri::generate_handler` macro with all function which are annotated with the `tauri_interop::command` macro. The 
function is only generated for tauri and not for wasm.

Due to technical limitations we sadly can't combine multiple `get_handlers` functions. This limitation comes to the 
underlying mechanic. The `tauri::generate_handler` macro generates a function which consumes `tauri::Invoke` as single 
parameter. Because it fully consumes the given parameter we can't call multiple handlers with it. In addition, the 
`Builder::invoke_handler` function, which usually consumes the generated `tauri::generate_handler` can't be called 
twice without losing the previous registered commands.

Because of this limitation for splitting commands into multiple files it is recommended to create a root mod for the 
command which includes other command mod's. The functions in the included mods need to be public and re-imported into 
the root mod. With these prerequisites the `tauri_invoke::collect_commands` can be called at the end of the file, which
generates the usual `get_handlers` function, but with all "commands" defined inside the others mods.

For an example see the [test-project/api/src/command.rs](test-project/api/src/command.rs).

### Event (Backend => Frontend Communication)
Definition for both tauri supported triplet and wasm:
```rust
use tauri_interop::Event;

#[derive(Default, Event)]
pub struct Test {
    foo: String,
    pub bar: bool,
}

// when main isn't defined, `super::Test` results in an error
fn main() {}
```

When using the derive macro `tauri_interop::Event` it expands depending on the `target_family` to
  - derive trait `tauri_interop::Listen` (when compiling to `wasm`)
  - derive trait `tauri_interop::Emit` (otherwise)

To emit a variable from the above struct (which is mostly intended to be used as state) in the host triplet
```rust , ignore-wasm32-unknown-unknown
use tauri_interop::{Event, event::emit::Emit};

#[derive(Default, Event)]
pub struct Test {
    foo: String,
    pub bar: bool,
}

// via `tauri_interop::Emit` a new module named after the struct (as snake_case) 
// is created where the struct Test is defined, here it creates module `test`
// in this module the related Fields are generated

// one context where `tauri::AppHandle` can be obtained
#[tauri_interop::command]
fn emit_bar(handle: tauri::AppHandle) {
    let mut t = Test::default();

    t.emit::<test::Foo>(&handle); // emits the current state: `false`
}

// a different context where `tauri::AppHandle` can be obtained
fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
      let handle: tauri::AppHandle = app.handle();
      
      let mut t = Test::default();

      // to emit and update a field an update function for each field is generated
      t.update::<test::Foo>(&handle, "Bar".into()); // assigns "Bar" to t.foo and emits the same value

      Ok(())
    });
}
```

the above emitted value can then be received in wasm as:
```rust , ignore
use tauri_interop::Event;

#[derive(Default, Event)]
pub struct Test {
    foo: String,
    pub bar: bool,
}

async fn main() {
  use tauri_interop::event::listen::Listen;

  let _listen_handle: ListenHandle<'_> = Test::listen_to::<test::Foo>(|foo| { /* use received foo: String here */ }).await;
}
```

The `ListenHandle` contains the provided closure and the "unlisten" method. It has to be hold in scope as long 
as the event should be received. Dropping it will automatically detach the closure from the event. See 
[cmd.rs](./test-project/api/src/cmd.rs) for other example how it could be used.

#### Feature: leptos
When the `leptos` feature is enabled the `use_field` method is added to the `Listen` trait when compiling to wasm. 
The method takes care of the initial asynchronous call to register the listener and will hold the handle in scope 
as long as the leptos component is rendered.

```rust , ignore
use tauri_interop::Event;

#[derive(Default, Event)]
pub struct Test {
    foo: String,
    pub bar: bool,
}

fn main() {
  use tauri_interop::event::listen::Listen;

  let foo: leptos::ReadSignal<String> = Test::use_field::<test::Foo>(String::default());
}
```

## Known Issues:
- feature: leptos
  - sometimes a closure is accessed after being dropped
  - that is probably a race condition where the unlisten function doesn't detach the callback fast enough
